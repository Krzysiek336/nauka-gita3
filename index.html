  	<h1>Avicii - Wake Me Up</h1>
  	<div>
	  	<p>Feeling my way through the darkness</p>
	  	<p>Guided by a beating heart</p>
	  	<p>I can't tell where the journey will end</p>
	  	<p>But I know where to start</p>
	  	<p>They tell me I'm too young to understand</p>
	  	<p>They say I'm caught up in a dream</p>
	  	<p>Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes</p>
	  	<p>Well that's fine by me</p>
  	</div>
	<div>
		<p>So wake me up when it's all over</p>
		<p>When I'm wiser and I'm older</p>
		<p>All this time I was finding myself and I</p>
		<p>Didn't know I was lost</p>
	</div>
